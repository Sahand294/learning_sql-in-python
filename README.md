# Learning Journey: Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Alembic, SQLAlchemy, SQLite

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress and projects as I learn Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Alembic, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite.

## Technologies I Am Learning

- **Python**: A versatile programming language used for scripting, automation, and backend development.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language for managing and querying databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database management system.
- **Alembic**: A lightweight database migration tool for SQLAlchemy.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Python.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database system ideal for small applications.

## Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of database management using SQL and PostgreSQL.
- Learn how to perform database migrations using Alembic.
- Understand how to integrate databases into Python applications with SQLAlchemy.
- Work with SQLite for lightweight applications.
- Build projects to apply my learning in real-world scenarios.

## Projects and Exercises

I will be working on various projects and exercises to reinforce my learning. Some planned projects include:

1. **Basic SQL Queries**: Writing and optimizing queries for retrieving data.
2. **Database Design**: Creating schemas, relationships, and normalizing databases.
3. **Python + SQLAlchemy**: Connecting Python applications to databases.
4. **Alembic Migrations**: Implementing schema changes using Alembic.
5. **CRUD Applications**: Developing applications that perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
6. **Web App with Flask/Django**: Integrating PostgreSQL with a web framework.
